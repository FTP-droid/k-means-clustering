# k-means-clustering
This is a test project using the k means clustering algorithm (implemented using python) to make findings regarding randomly generated data.

The results of the project are as expected with the K means algorithm sucessfully implemented using python.

The model generated is very good at predicting the cluster location of values within the boundaries of the values in X.
